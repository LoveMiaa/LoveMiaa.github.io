## Gun Violence: In Our Community


* Gun violence disproportionately impacts communities of color that have suffered from long-standing race-based redlining and disinvestment. Community gun violence is   highly concentrated among a small number of people living in underserved communities. These individuals are often caught in cycles of victimization, trauma, and    retaliatory violence. For generations, policing and incarceration have been the primary means to address gun violence in underserved communities and often these  systems have perpetuated or exacerbated racial equities. Our center is actively working on understanding how and advocating for public health strategies that  successfully engage with individuals at highest risk of violence or that alter the conditions that promote violence. CVI has the potential to reduce violence if  adequately implemented and funded. These programs, often called community violence interventions (CVI), can significantly reduce gun violence in the most impacted   communities.


# 3 Ways To Reduce Gun Violence


* Pass Gun Laws That Actually Reduce Gun Violence.

Not all gun laws are created equal. The military-grade rifles used in many mass shootings may dominate the political debate, but they account for less than 5% of homicides. Meanwhile, research published in JAMA Internal Medicine in early March found that strong firearms laws in a state, such as background checks for all private sales and restrictions on multiple purchases, were associated with lower rates of gun homicides.


* Invest In Smart Technology


When Smith & Wesson, one of the largest handgun manufacturers in the U.S, agreed to develop smart-gun technology in the wake of the Columbine school shooting in 2000, the NRA condemned the company. Gun owners boycotted, and sales plummeted. No major gun manufacturers have invested in the technology since.


* Eliminate Funding Restrictions On Violence Research


According to a 2017 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, gun violence should have received $1.4 billion in federal research money from 2004 to 2015, on the basis of mortality rates and funding levels for other leading causes of death. Instead, such projects received $22 millionâ€“just 1.6% of the projected amount. Gun violence received 5.3% of the federal research funds allocated for motor-vehicle accidents, even though they kill similar numbers of Americans per year.



## What Effect Does Gun Violence Have On Our Community


The impact of gun violence is far reaching and devastating. By understanding the impact and acknowledging shared concerns. Guns and domestic violence have long been a deadly combination. Every 16 hours an ultimate partner with a gun kills a person in the U.S. In addition to the physical danger guns pose, research reveals long term emotional and behavioral effects of violence, aggression, depression and anxiety resulting from exposure to domestic violence. Gun Violence has changed the way many Americans live their lives. Exposure to gun Violence can create a cycle of violence. Pyschological effects may include anger and disassociation, and an increased likelihood that violence will be used to resolve problems or express emotions.
